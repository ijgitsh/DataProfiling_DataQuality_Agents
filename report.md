### Data Quality Tasks Summary
- Several departments have been identified as invalid, specifically **Engineering** and **Unknown**. This hints at potential issues in data entry or categorization.
- Duplicate records exist, particularly for IDs like **1234**, **1339**, and **1408**, suggesting a need for deduplication efforts.
